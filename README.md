Simple project that shows how to build the tcpecho example from the [LPCOpen Libraries and Examples](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/software-development-tools/lpc-developer-resources-/lpcopen-libraries-and-examples:LPC-OPEN-LIBRARIES) kit against the [FreeRTOS simulator](https://github.com/megakilo/FreeRTOS-Sim) in combination with [lwIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/).

At some point this project will hopefully contain more examples and offer a CMake toolchain file so other projects can easily integrate it into their workflow for qualification purposes.
